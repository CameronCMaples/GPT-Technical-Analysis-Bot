# GPT-Technical-Analysis-Bot
The following is a simple technical analysis assistant made using an OpenAI API call. Within the code you will notice a ticker variable, for the code provided I have chosen $TSLA, but you can switch this out to any ticker. You can also edit the prompt as well as the timeframe for the candles you want GPT 3.5 to analyze. I would advise you to be conservitive as you can easily break the token limit by going into timeframes under 1d. For instance, calling the api with 15m candle data will break the token limit. Also obviously don't take it as hard financial advise, I have not tested its outcomes for accuracy or profitability.
