# GPT-Technical-Analysis-Bot
The following is a simple technical analysis assistant made using an OpenAI API call. Within the code you will notice a ticker variable. You can also edit the prompt as well as the timeframe for the candles you want GPT 3.5 to analyze. I would advise you to be conservitive as you can easily break the token limit by going into timeframes under 1d. For instance, calling the api with 15m candle data for the last sixty days will break the token limit. Also, obviously don't take it as hard financial advice. I have not tested its outputs for accuracy or profitability.
